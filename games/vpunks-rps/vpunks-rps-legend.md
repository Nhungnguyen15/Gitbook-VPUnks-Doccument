Once upon a time, in the land of VPunks, there was an exciting turn-based mini-game called VPunks RPS. This game was specifically designed for VPunk Holers. VPunks RPS was a thrilling battle of wits and strategy, revolving around the ancient game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.

In VPunks RPS, there were only three possible outcomes: win, lose, or draw. Each player had to choose one of three options: rock, paper, or scissors. The rules were simple yet powerful. A player choosing rock would triumph over an opponent choosing scissors. However, a rock would not yield to the power of paper. On the other hand, a player choosing paper would be defeated by an opponent choosing scissors.

The battles were balanced and fair, leaving no room for luck or chance. It was a true test of skill and strategic thinking. Every decision mattered, and every move had consequences. Players had to observe their opponent's tendencies, try to predict their choices, and carefully consider their options. Because the loser had to surrender the entire $VPU amount that both players had wagered to the winner.

The VPunks RPS battles reached their climax, leaving unforgettable experiences for both players and spectators. It showcased the power of strategy and the excitement of competition, attracting players from all corners of the VPunks community to engage in epic battles that lay ahead.
