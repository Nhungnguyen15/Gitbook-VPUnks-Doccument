# âœŒ VPunks RPS

* VPunks RPS is a turn-based mini-game made for players who own VPunks.&#x20;
* The game has only three fair outcomes: win, lose, draw.
* A player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors ("rock crushes scissors" or "breaks scissors" or sometimes "blunts scissors"), but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock"); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cuts paper"). If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie
* Learn about the countermeasures between rock, paper, scissors options to determine victory or defeat.
