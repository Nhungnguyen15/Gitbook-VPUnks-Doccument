# About VPunks Weapons

VPunks Weapons are an integral part of the VPunks Project, specifically designed for use in the VPunks Arena. These weapons possess unique attributes associated with different elements, including metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. Each element corresponds to a specific weapon type: Nunchaku, Spear, Axe, Cub, and Sword, respectively.

The VPunks Weapons collection consists of three levels, denoted as level 1, level 2, and level 3. Each level represents an increment in power and capabilities. These levels allow players to strategize and choose weapons that align with their gameplay style.
